# Midnight Deep Visual Studio Theme

⚫ **Midnight Deep** is a fork of my other theme 🌌 **Midnight Lights** available [here](https://github.com/austinstanding/midnight-lights-vstheme). This aims to be a true dark theme for Visual Studio 2019 and 2022.

This theme was born out of a need for darkness; to rest my eyes after an extended period of working long hours and feeling like all the other dark themes just weren't dark enough. This aims to be that dark theme. Midnight Deep draws from the palette of Midnight Lights, while providing a true hex #000000 background and lower brightness generally. This won't be for everyone or every occasion, but my vision is to provide an after hours theme that will let your eyes find rest even when you can't.

## Installation

After [installing the extension from the Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AustinStanding.vsthememidnightdeep), the theme will be available in the dropdown under *Tools -> Theme* or *Tools -> Options -> General*.

## Misc

CI/CD uses Azure DevOps, following [Meziantou's Blog](https://www.meziantou.net/ci-cd-pipeline-for-a-visual-studio-extension-vsix-using-azure-devops.htm). CD presently disabled as VsixPublisher does not support the Themes category.

With introduction of breaking changes or new themed features previous elements are kept for backwards compatibility.
