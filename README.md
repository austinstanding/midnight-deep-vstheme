# Midnight Lights Visual Studio Theme

ðŸŒŒ Midnight Lights is a dark theme for Visual Studio 2019, made with [Color Theme Designer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-madsk.ColorThemeDesigner).

This is my first theme and you will probably find some quirks. This is a personal project which I'm sharing with you. I'm not planning on making regular updates or taking requests, but feel free to fork!
