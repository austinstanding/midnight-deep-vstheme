# Midnight Deep Visual Studio Theme

*DISCLAIMER: This is a work in progress! I have a lot of refining to do before this is released on the VS Marketplace.*

âš« **Midnight Deep** is a fork of my other theme ðŸŒŒ **Midnight Lights** available [here](https://github.com/austinstanding/midnight-deep-vstheme). This aims to be a true dark theme for Visual Studio 2019.

This theme was born out of a need for darkness; to rest my eyes after an extended period of working long hours and feeling like all the other dark themes just weren't dark enough. This aims to be that dark theme. Midnight Deep draws from the palette of Midnight Lights, while providing a true hex #000000 background and lower brightness generally. I understand this won't be for everyone, but my vision for this is to provide an after hours theme that will let your eyes find rest even when you can't.

## Misc

CI/CD uses Azure DevOps, following [Meziantou's Blog](https://www.meziantou.net/ci-cd-pipeline-for-a-visual-studio-extension-vsix-using-azure-devops.htm).

I like to extend my theme with [Viasfora](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TomasRestrepo.Viasfora), mostly for Rainbow Braces. I've added my Viasfora theme within the github repo as `viasfora-theme.json`. If you're a Viasfora user, themes can be exported/imported from *Tools -> Options -> Viasfora -> Import/Export*.
